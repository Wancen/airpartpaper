* [Larsson2019](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Wancen/airpartpaper/blob/main/Larsson2019/Larsson2019.html): [Larsson et al.(2019)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0836-1)  contains  224mouse embryo stem cells (C57BL/6×CAST/EiJ) and 188 mouse embryofibroblasts (CAST/EiJ×C57BL/6J) including across states of cell cycle(G1, S, G2M), as identified by the author
  
* [Deng2014](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Wancen/airpartpaper/blob/main/Deng2014/Deng2014.html): [Deng et al.(2014)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0836-1) includes 286 pre-implantation mouse embryo cells composed of10 cell types from an F1 cross of female CAST/EiJ and male C57BL/6Jmice. Cells were sampled along a time course from the zygote and early2-cell stages through the late blastocyst stage of development.

* [spatialDmelxsim](https://github.com/Wancen/airpartpaper/blob/main/spatialDmelxsim/spatialDmelxsim.R): [Combsand Fraser (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1007631) performed RNA-seq of five hybrid Drosophila species D.melanogaster×D.simulans  embryos  sliced  along  their  anterior-posterior axis to identify genes with spatially varying allelic imbalance.
