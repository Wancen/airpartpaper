* Larsson2019: Larssonet al.(2019)  contains  224mouse embryo stem cells (C57BL/6×CAST/EiJ) and 188 mouse embryofibroblasts (CAST/EiJ×C57BL/6J) including across states of cell cycle(G1, S, G2M), as identified by the author
  
* Deng2014: Denget al.(2014) includes 286 pre-implantation mouse embryo cells composed of10 cell types from an F1 cross of female CAST/EiJ and male C57BL/6Jmice. Cells were sampled along a time course from the zygote and early2-cell stages through the late blastocyst stage of development.

* spatialDmelxsim: Combsand Fraser (2018) performed RNA-seq of five hybrid Drosophila species D.melanogaster×D.simulans  embryos  sliced  along  their  anterior-posterior axis to identify genes with spatially varying allelic imbalance.
