Code for analyses in [*airpart*](https://github.com/Wancen/airpart) paper

* [Larsson2019](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Wancen/airpartpaper/blob/main/Larsson2019/Larsson2019.html): [Larsson et al.(2019)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0836-1)  contains  224mouse embryo stem cells (C57BL/6×CAST/EiJ) and 188 mouse embryofibroblasts (CAST/EiJ×C57BL/6J) including across states of cell cycle(G1, S, G2M), as identified by the author
  
* [Deng2014](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Wancen/airpartpaper/blob/main/Deng2014/Deng2014.html): [Deng et al.(2014)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0836-1) includes 286 pre-implantation mouse embryo cells composed of10 cell types from an F1 cross of female CAST/EiJ and male C57BL/6Jmice. Cells were sampled along a time course from the zygote and early2-cell stages through the late blastocyst stage of development.

* [spatialDmelxsim](https://github.com/Wancen/airpartpaper/blob/main/spatialDmelxsim/spatialDmelxsim.R): [Combsand Fraser (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1007631) performed RNA-seq of five hybrid Drosophila species D.melanogaster×D.simulans  embryos  sliced  along  their  anterior-posterior axis to identify genes with spatially varying allelic imbalance.

* [DynamicASE](https://github.com/Wancen/airpartpaper/blob/main/DynamicASE/README.md): [Gutierrez-Arceluset al.(2020)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-020-0579-4) stimulated memory CD4+ T cells from 24 genotyped individuals of European ancestry with anti-CD3/CD28 beads and  characterized  the  dynamics  of  ASE  events  at  0,  2,  4,  8,  12, 24, 48  and  72  hours  after  stimulation. 

* [sim](https://github.com/Wancen/airpartpaper/blob/main/sim/README.md): to assess airpart’s partitioning of cell types by allelic ratio, and its accuracy of estimates of the allelic ratio itself, a number of simulations were performed.
